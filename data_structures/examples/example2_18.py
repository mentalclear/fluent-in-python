# As you can see, array.tofile and array.fromfile are easy to use. 
# If you try the example, youâ€™ll notice they are also very fast. 
# A quick experiment shows that it takes about 0.1s for array.fromfile 
# to load 10 million double-precision floats from a binary file 
# created with array.tofile.
